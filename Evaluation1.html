<h2>Evaluation</h2>


			<br><br>
			<h3>Evaluation Strategy</h3><p id="main-paragraph">
				<b>Purpose of the evaluation:</b><br>
Compare two prototypes, find which features worked better in each prototype, check if the app meets the requirements<br><br>
<b>Type of data collected:</b><br> qualitative and quantitative<br><br>
<b>Type of questions asked:</b><br> to get qualitative and quantitative data<br><br>
<b>Constraints:</b><br> time: 20 minutes, 2-5 minutes per student, <br>environment: computer lab<br><br><br></p>

<h3>Evaluation Plan</h3>
<p>Define roles for the evaluation (who does what)<br><br>
Introduce the users to the app (briefing)<br><br>
Explain prototype limitations<br><br>
Ask to complete 2 tasks (review and find similar) and time them<br><br>
Ask to examine the alternative prototype<br><br>
Ask specific questions: 
<i>What was not intuitive? 
What was good? 
What was out of place?
Which version did they prefer and why?</i><br><br>
Ask different demographics<br><br>
Time same tasks using conventional means (Google maps)<br><br>
Observe<br><br>

Hello! Welcome to an evaluation for our augmented reality travel app, TravelAR. Our app allows users to view the information connected to locations in the AR view. The app would be best utilized in situations where the user is discovering a new location or encountering a language barrier. In this evaluation we have created two prototypes that we would like you to try out and give us your opinion on. The first prototype is a more complete demonstration of how the app will perform, while the second is limited in scope but has an alternate aesthetic and adjustments to some specific interactions. Please agree to our consent form to it in order to participate in this evaluation, you will remain completely anonymous, but by agreeing you are giving us consent to use your feedback in the next stages of the project. <br>
For this session you will be evaluating how you found the process of leaving a review on a nearby location you have just visited, but do not know the name of. For the next task, please return to the main screen, we would now like you to find a similar restaurant to the nearby restaurant, which on your second visit is completely packed. Please get to screen which displays all this similar restaurants information to complete the task.  While you are doing this try to consider the interface which you are interacting with, there will be a short google docs questionnaire afterwards which will ask for feedback on select aspects of the prototype and your preferred prototype alternative. Please communicate if you thought a process was easy, confusing, misleading, or difficult. Thank you for participating in this evaluation.
