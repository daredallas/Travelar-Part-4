<h2>Design Recommendation</h2>

			
			<h3> </h3>

<p id="main-paragraph">
<b>Tag System was Observed as Unintuitive</b><br><br>
The tags we implemented were buttons corresponding to categories that the restaurant belonged to. 
	Since participants had trouble determining the function of these buttons, we recommend altering the visuals of the tag and any other button that is interactive to have the same scheme. 
	As a result, the application would have a common design for buttons that can be interacted with. 
	There is already a theme in the app for buttons where the review button has a coloured border, and using this theme for all buttons including the tags is one way to reduce confusion. 
	Additionally, review is a relatively known and familiar interaction for locations and by connecting a common interaction with a theme and replicating it, other interactive buttons could become more intuitive by association.
<br><br>
 A simpler alternative solution for the tags would be to add more identifying text that would explicitly state that the tags are interactive. 
	This solution would take away from the minimalist aesthetic of the tags, but clearly stating the available actions would hopefully solve the problem of confusion.
	One user recommended adding a search feature to find specific restaurants nearby, but we aim to give the user nearby location data. 
	A search feature for citywide locations does not line up with this goal and we believe that the modifications to the tag system would reduce confusion and maintain focus on the most important parts of our app.

<br><br>
<b>Smaller Clickable Buttons</b><br>
Some participants recommended clarifying the location identifier bubbles, and we believe that displaying the full name of a location could make it harder to distinguish where the bubble points to.
	To make the interface clearer, small icons that would be standard for search functions such as the restaurant symbol of utensils or beds for hotels could be incorporated.
	This will allow the user to quickly scan for a certain type of location while also allowing us to maintain a database of categories of locations instead of fully loading the information for each location.
