<b>What aspects of your preferred version of the UI did you like?</b><br><br>
<p align = "left">
<ul>
	<li>That the name of the place was displayed and that you could select tags separately in the first version</li>
	<li>The pop up menu was non invasive and didn’t take you to a new page in the first version</li>
	<li>The first version was more intuitive and also had a very familiar layout similar to google and yelp </li>
	<li>I liked the smaller icons while viewing because it was not very intrusive in the second version</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>
<b>What aspects of your preferred version of the UI did you dislike?</b><br><br>
<p align = "left">
<ul>
	<li>The second version simply had exclamation marks, with no real context to them </li>
	<li>The second version brought you to a new page and I would have preferred a pop up instead </li>
	<li>the page that showed the top view of the building was confusing in the second version</li>
	<li>Nothing in particular, I just liked the first version better. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>
<b>What element of the interface were you confused or when were you confused?</b><br><br>
