<h2>Data and Results</h2>

<p>For the purpose of collecting user data we created a Google Form available <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdTwLro260pbOhG8yNDAuM0GkgRcR8v9ik5tdMvOrtSjiCG7A/viewform">here</a>.</p>
			
			<h3>Collecting Results</h3>

<p id="main-paragraph">
	During the test, the quantitative result that we will be collecting the amount of time it takes to complete each of the tasks. Using a timer on a group member’s phone, we will be watching while they complete the process and recording the time taken for each task.

	In the post test survey, we will ask 4 questions that will produce qualitative results:

<h3>Quantitative Questions</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
During the test, quantitative results that we will be collecting is the amount of time it takes to complete each of the tasks. 
	Using a timer on a group member’s phone, we will be watching while they complete the process and record the time taken for each task.
<br><br>
    In the post test survey, we will ask 4 questions that will produce quantitative results:<br><br>

<div style="text-align:left">
<ol>
<li><b>Which of the two prototype interfaces did you prefer?(First/Second)</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>The differences between the two prototypes were:</li>
<li>Location names in the original prototype were clickable buttons with text on them while the second prototype did not have text on the buttons and the buttons were small and round instead. </li>
<li>In the original prototype after clicking on a location, the app would take the user to a bubble with a short description of the location and then the user could click on more to see the full description page. In the second prototype, the user was taken directly to the full description page. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>	
<li><b>Did the aesthetic of the preferred user interface distract or confuse you while trying to complete a task?(Yes/No)</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>The aesthetic of the interface may distract users so that they cannot find certain features, or misinterpret certain elements. The response will let us know if our interfaces are confusing.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>	
<li><b>Did you like how you can click on a location and it shows you a bubble with only a summary or would you rather go straight to the full description page?(Multiple choice)</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>This was a very important question to us since the bubble adds an extra step to the process and it was necessary for us to know whether it was worth it or not.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>	
<li><b>Was it clear where you could interact with the prototype?(Yes/No)</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>We needed to know whether the users could easily find buttons and navigate to their desired page.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
</div>
<br><br>
</p>	
<h3>Qualitative Questions</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
During the evaluation we will record observations as we watch the task being completed. 
	These observations will be comments on where a user became confused, made errors, and if they required additional hints. 
	These observations will be used in conjunction with the post test questionnaire to illustrate problematic areas of the prototype.
<br><br>
In our post test survey, we asked four qualitative questions to get feedback on our design: 
<br><br>
<div style="text-align:left">
<ol>
<li><b>What aspects of the UI did you like about you preferred version?</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>This question serves to assist in identifying what the best aspects of either design were. User feedback on the best aspects could help to adjust our focus from aspects which do not need improvement.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>	
<li><b>What aspects of the UI did you dislike about your non preferred version?(Yes/No)</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>This questions helps to identify what aspects are not working, and where we should focus our attention on improvement.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>	
<li><b>If the response to the question of if the interface confused or distracted you during the task was ‘Yes”, what element of the interface were you confused or when were you confused?</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>This question works together with the observations made by us to identify where the interface was confusing. It gets the user perspective on confusing areas of the prototype to specifically identify sources of confusion or distraction.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<li><b>Do you have any other suggestions for the interface?(Yes/No)</b>
</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>Left as an open ended closing question, this will allow for feedback that our short survey does not specifically ask for.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
</div>
<br><br>

<h3>Results</h3>

<br><br>
Of the five participants which we tested our app with, four completed our post test questionnaire. 
	From these responses and timings and observations made during the tests, we have the following results.<br><br>
Responses to the quantitative questions gave us insight into the four questions which we posed. 
	Three out of four participants preferred our original design and were not confused by the user interface. 
	All participants thought the interactable aspects were clear and preferred the intermediate bubble UI. 
	From our testing, we recorded the time to complete a review and then the time to find a similar restaurant to the one in the simulated AR view. 
	The time to leave a review was mostly consistent at roughly 30 seconds, this task also included logging in and reaching the main screen in this time. 
	For finding a similar restaurant task, the participants started from whatever screen they were at previously but this was not a consistent basis for testing the time and the data is unevenly spread because of it. 
<br><br>
The Qualitative short answer questions and the qualitative observations supplied much more interesting data. 
	From our observations and some user feedback on what confused them, the tag buttons for finding a similar location were identified as unintuitive. 
	One participant even became completely stuck and gave up when they could not find how to find a similar location and was also the only one who said that they became confused by our interface. 
	Some of the participants suggested adding or modifying features such as a search function, map screen, smaller icons, and a single similar places button.

<b>What aspects of your preferred version of the UI did you like?</b></p>
<p align = "left">
<div style="text-align:left">
<ul>
	<li><p>That the name of the place was displayed and that you could select tags separately in the first version</p></li>
	<li>The pop up menu was non invasive and didn’t take you to a new page in the first version</li>
	<li>The first version was more intuitive and also had a very familiar layout similar to google and yelp </li>
	<li>I liked the smaller icons while viewing because it was not very intrusive in the second version</li>
</ul>
</div>
</p>
<br><br>
<b>What aspects of your preferred version of the UI did you dislike?</b><br><br>
<p align = "left">
<div style="text-align:left">
<ul>
	<li>The second version simply had exclamation marks, with no real context to them </li>
	<li>The second version brought you to a new page and I would have preferred a pop up instead </li>
	<li>the page that showed the top view of the building was confusing in the second version</li>
	<li>Nothing in particular, I just liked the first version better. </li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<b>What element of the interface were you confused or when were you confused?</b><br><br>

<p align = "left">
<div style="text-align:left">
<ul>
	<li>There was no similarity option so I was confused that I had to click on the tags in the first version</li>

</ul>

</p>
<br><br>
<b>Do you have any other suggestions for the interface?</b><br><br>
<p align = "left">
<div style="text-align:left">
<ul>
	<li>To have a button on the original interface to be able to search for all tags being similar, rather than just individually</li>
	<li>Having the similarity button for the first design, and having a map feature like the second design would be best </li>
	<li>A prototype of the "take a picture" function so the user could see what it might look like before taking the picture</li>
	<li>Both versions lacked a search functionality that would've been useful for the task of finding a restaurant</li>
