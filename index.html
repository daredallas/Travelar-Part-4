<h2>Introduction</h2>

			
			<p id="main-paragraph">Tourism is an enormous industry and with the prevalence of phones and access to information throughout the world, it is easier than ever for people to experience different locales. However, unfamiliarity can be a problem that keeps many travellers from fully experiencing the location around them. Since almost every traveller will bring at least a smartphone, there are many opportunities to use the platforms they already have to solve their problems. We are proposing an augmented reality travel app, with the goal to provide an easily usable application which enhances a travellerâ€™s experience with valuable information about their surroundings. </p>
